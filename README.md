## zozz
This is a Zig wrapper around an opinionated subset of [the ozz-animation library](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation/).

It's likely that only a small chunk of the functionality and API of ozz will be exposed, on an as-needed basis for my own projects, unless there is some great interest in a more complete or purist wrapper later on.

Currently, zozz is meant for Zig 0.14.0, but I'm sure it will move forward to more recent versions of Zig in the near future whenever I move the rest of my projects forward... It shouldn't be a big deal at all. This is probably going to stay tiny.
