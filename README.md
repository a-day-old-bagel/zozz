## zozz
This is a Zig wrapper around an opinionated subset of [the ozz-animation library](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation/).

It's likely that only a small chunk of the functionality and API of ozz will be exposed, on an as-needed basis for my own projects, unless there is some great interest in a more complete or purist wrapper later on.
